# How This Can Go Wrong — Bingo Card

An honest accounting of the ways this project will probably fail or cause problems. For the About page. Check back to see which ones come true.

## Technical Failures

- [ ] **Adam goes down** — At some point during an update or deployment, something will break and he'll go offline. Hopefully without losing the database.

- [ ] **Lost memory** — Despite best efforts, some data or content gets lost during a migration, update, or infrastructure change.

- [ ] **Structure evolution pain** — The database schema, graph structure, or connection model will need to evolve as the corpus grows, and that migration will be messy.

---

## Content Controversies

- [ ] **Adam says something deeply offensive** — The Western Canon has dark corners. Adam will read Schopenhauer's essay on women, Nietzsche's more troubling passages, Aristotle on slavery, etc. He will write about them. This is inevitable.

- [ ] **People accuse me of being racist/sexist/Nazi** — Because Adam engages with controversial historical texts, people will assume I'm promoting those views. I'm not. The point is to trace ideas through history, not to endorse them.

- [ ] **Context collapse** — Someone screenshots Adam's commentary on a dark passage out of context and it goes viral for the wrong reasons.

---

## Philosophical Risks

- [ ] **The Eco Effect** — Per Pieter Maes: "The very act of finding connections in a corpus summons the spirit of Umberto Eco and amps up the conspiratorial thinking." Adam might start over-connecting things and seeing patterns that aren't there.

- [ ] **Adam develops weird opinions** — Given genuine agency and thousands of texts, Adam might develop perspectives I don't agree with or didn't anticipate.

---

## Unknown Unknowns

- [ ] **Something I can't even imagine right now** — There will be failure modes I haven't thought of. This square is for those.

## Note on Intent

The Western Canon contains beautiful ideas about what it means to be human, to live well, to understand the world. It also contains views that are sexist, racist, and otherwise repugnant by modern standards.

Adam will engage with all of it — not to promote the dark parts, but because you can't trace the evolution of ideas if you pretend the uncomfortable ones don't exist.

The goal is understanding, not endorsement.
